<h3>Characterisation of doping in nanowires by off-axis electron holography</h3>

<p>
Nanowires (NWs) are structures with length typically on the order of microns and diameter on the order of tens to hundreds of nanometers. Group III-V semiconductor NWs are investigated for applications such as solar cells, photodetectors and sensors. GaAs NWs grown on a Si substrate from a Ga droplet catalyst are shown in Figure 1.
For solar cell NWs, the control of doping and electrostatic potential distribution is important and challenging. The doping can be assessed by <strong><em>off-axis electron holography</em></strong> in a transmission electron microscope. This is one of the most powerful methods for dopant assessment, since it enables to measure a spatially-resolved phase contrast from a specimen due to its electrostatic potential. A schematic of the off-axis electron holography technique is shown in Figure 2 and it can be performed at the FEI Analytical Titan 80-300ST TEM, located at DTU Cen.
An example of the electrostatic potential distribution measured by electron holography across a GaP NW is reported in Figure 3. The measured built-in potential from holography can be correlated with the forward turn-on voltage in p-n junction diodes, or with the open-circuit voltage in photovoltaic devices. Cross-sectional specimens for off-axis electron holography are prepared perpendicular to the growth direction of the NWs using focused ion beam (FIB) milling, which is a techniques available at the FEI Helios dual beam, located at DTU Cen.<br>
