<h2>English information</h2>
<p>
The student research initative is a project developed by the Department of Physics in an attempt to make students and staff at the department work closer together in an early phase of the studies. One of the incentives to close the gap between students and lecturers is to give students the opportunity to work closer with the professors and other staffs research before they choose their masters project. Some members of the staff already include interested students in projects, however there are only a few students that are aware of this opportunity today. With this webpage we hope more students get knowledge of these opportunities and choose to take contact with their lecturers and other members of the staff.
</p>

<p>
Another aspect of the initative and purpose of this page is to make it easier for students to create and get involved in student projects. The student projects can be everything from small experiments connected with a certain topic in a subject, or big interdisciplinary projects including many students and professors mentoring them. The <a title="piazza.com" href="https://piazza.com/">forum</a> page can be used to discuss and create new ideas to student projects with fellow students from other classes.
</p>

<p>
In a long perspective we hope this again will lead to greater knowledge of applied and theoretical physics. Applying and using the knowledge you gain from class on practical problems and real situations will broaden the understanding of scientific method and research. We also believe that seeing how you can use the knowledge you gain in class will lead to a greater interest in physics, and hope this makes the students even more motivated to learn.
